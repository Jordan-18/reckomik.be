Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the ""Abyss""—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.

One day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Legto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.

When Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Engine, who reveals himself to be a ""janitor""—someone who uses special weapons called ""jinkis"" to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Legto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a janitor to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.

Little Mushroom,小蘑菇,manga,"“Until the day humanity falls.”

In the year 2020, Earth’s magnetic poles disappeared and humankind was nearly wiped out by cosmic radiation. Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.

In the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.

An Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.

But An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…

Rewrite - Dear Secret Rose (Doujinshi),Rewrite - ディアシークレットローズ,manga,"""You have power, and you are dissatisfied with the world. Would you want to change the world… or would you rather change yourself?” — Akane Senri.

That was the beginning. A single choice that ultimately led to a global genocide, and a world where only two thousand humans survived...  by the very grace of those responsible.

In the eco-centric city of Kazamatsuri, a boy named Kotarou strives to assert himself in high school and attain an ordinary, peaceful life, but finds himself afflicted by odd phenomena within the city that seem supernatural. In his curiosity, he seeks out the rumored witch of the occult club, Akane Senri, and is inspired to join her club to prove the supernatural exists.

Undeterred by her mysteriously probing questions and prickly nature, Kotarou brings life to the club and even recruits new members, forming a circle of friends in the process. But when they finally find proof, it becomes apparent that these strange events are symptoms of a dying world., and that his friends are hiding secret agendas fated to clash over this very subject.

After the club collapses, Kotarou puts his trust in Akane and decides to serve as her shield to aid her work within ""Gaia""-  a cult of environmentalist mages determined to preserve nature at any cost. As Kotarou's actions behind the scenes grow in proportion to Akane's influence and leadership within Gaia, the pair's emotions become increasingly entwined.

Yet, physiological changes brought by their occultic work and the weight of the roles they inhabit chip away at their sense of selves, causing them to reflect upon the blurriness of their own memories and question the history of their relationship. The two who love the other above all else may be destined for naught but tragedy, if they let it defeat them.

Oh, whatever, now that it's come to this, the only way to survive is to raise the male lead into a sane and stable adult! The first step to avoiding death by the hands of the tyrant male lead is changing this extremely frightened child's life.

Will Clete's powers be enough to alter the future? Or will she inevitably meet her tragic end?

Here, inside this martial arts novel, there is a true teacher who teaches the arrogant male lead and awakens him through death.

A tenacious villainous extra, who always comes back to haunt the male lead in every way, but cannot be abandoned because she is his teacher's daughter. Throughout reading the novel, I cursed at that daughter. Saying that if it were me, I wouldn't live like that.

'But that didn't mean that I wanted to be her!'

What was worse, Father has already died, and my reputation was the worst. Inevitably, I ran away, but… I died. However, when I opened my eyes, Father was alive?!

'If so, in this life, I will definitely save Father!'

However…

""To think they’re aiming for my granddaughter?! I'll kill them all!""

Why do I see Grandfather, who doesn't even appear many times throughout the novel, so often like this?

""Marriage? No. Yeonie said that she would live by my side for the rest of her life.""

Even Father, somehow became weird. Moreover:

""Why do you keep avoiding me? Is this also my mistake?""

Isn't the main character suddenly becoming obsessed with me?

""Originally, I was destined to die. Until you came here.""

I saved the time-limited bastard, but isn’t it that no good deed goes unpunished?

""At least when I'm in front of you… I don't think I’m trash.""

The villain who blew off my neck is suddenly trying to repent.

Is it really okay if it's like this?

A delightfully charming romantic comedy about a boy who only has eyes for the girl who always forgets her glasses!

With the new school year comes a new homeroom, new classmates, and a new desk for the timid Komura. But any trepidation he might've felt quickly dissipates when he catches sight of Mie, his new seat neighbor.

As a self-professed no-lifer, Yuri idles his days away in front of a computer.

War is a distant problem, relevant only to Shiyalta’s ruling families whose warriors periodically set out to join the fighting upon massive birds trained by Yuri’s dad and others. But this peaceful existence can’t last forever.

Then one day, his father's best friend the Duke, who had been searching for the male lead for 10 years, finally found the orphanage. 

“I'll adopt this child here. Oh, and the child next to him too.”

Wait, why am I also getting adopted?!

He wants me as his daughter-in-law for the male lead?!? 

What about the female lead??

He was supposed to return from the battlefield with the female lead, so I carefully prepared for a divorce and made a lot of money so I can live by myself! But…

“Damian, did you come home alone? Did no one else come with you?”

“Someone else?” Upon hearing my question, Damian’s gaze suddenly sharpened.

“Ellie. are you looking for a man other than your husband?” 

“Huh?”

“That's no good, I would probably kill that man out of jealousy.”

I looked over to my father-in-law for help.

But then, she found out that a priest secretly sold her to be a one-night stand for the duke who kills his lovers due to the shame of his inability to perform…

There’s only one way to get out of this, and it is to be a married woman.

At that moment, Isabelle recalled her childhood friend, Riggs, who said he wasn’t interested in dating.

“So, Riggs, marry me.”

“…What?”

“Nobles would refuse unless it’s a pure woman.”

“…Why do you hate the Duke of Cardiago so much?”

“Everything else is fine. Being a tyrant? If you’ve lived your life to the fullest, that could happen. But there can be no problems at night.”

Riggs was so frustrated that it seemed like he was going crazy.

A few days later, the reclusive Duke of Cardiago came to the temple.

Of course, the most surprising thing to Isabelle was the true identity of her childhood friend.

“Isabelle, you wanted to get married. You can’t say no because you proposed first. I’m the closest man to your ideal type anyway.”

“My ideal type?”

“Don’t I know your ideal type? You like guys who are tall, handsome, smell of soap at night, and sleep in simple clothes. Also, on the first night, the bed should break.”

“…”

“That’s everything, and I can do it all for you. So marry me.”

She once knew everything about her childhood friend, but that changed the moment they got married.

“Riggs, slow down…”

“I think I’m slow enough.”

“You weren’t always this impatient.”

Isabelle said pleadingly, but Riggs replied with a smirk.

“I was a childhood friend then, but now I’m your husband.”

It was finally the moment where all of her crazy deeds in the past came to fruition; because the only way she could escape being sent off for Royal Marriage was to throw away the image of a Princess that everyone expected.

She chose to cut her hair short and be reborn as the Crazy Flower in the Royal Palace.

From an early age, he used his dexterity to contribute to his peers in a variety of crafts. Leopin and his friends entered the Royal Pioneer Academy. However, during the “Ritual of Ability Development” at the entrance ceremony, the status given to Leopin was disastrous.

“Occupation: Unemployed.”

“All statuses except dexterity remain at their initial values and do not grow.”

“Skill is dextrous master of none”

Leopin’s classmates exiled him because he had nothing to offer other than his dexterity. Leopin is placed in the “Special Training Class”, a class for failures. Leopin is left all alone. However, he realizes that the skill he has been given, “Poor Dexterity,” has an unexpected performance. That is…

You can convert your dexterity status to any other status.
You can change your occupation to any one you want.

The first thing Leopin did was to become a lumberjack. First, Leopin changed his job to “Lumberjack” to get wood from the forest. He then became a carpenter and built the most magnificent house of all. He became an Appraiser to identify rare items, and a Battle Axe User to fight off students from other classes who tried to attack him. Become a Ranger to explore dungeons and a Ninja to get through traps with ease.

Leopin, alone (solo), had gained enough power to do everything.

As Leopin continues to be a warrior, he is adored by his childhood friend, a saint, and admired by a beautiful alchemist, and his activities become even more well known. On the other hand, the classmates who expelled Leopin regret their decision to do so when they witness Leopin’s abilities.

Their home remains a shack, they are unable to explore, and they gradually lose their place in the school and are ruined.

*Explanation: the skill is not “poor dexterity”, but “dexterous poor”, which is the Japanese equivalent to a Jack of all trades, master of none; since they can do a bit of everything, they are “dexterous”, but since they have mastered none, they supposedly cannot make a living from it, hence they are “poor”.  Another manner of saying you have high dexterity is to be ""handy"", back-translated from DEX as in *manual* dexterity from early RPGs.

I was condemned as a cruel villain and sentenced to death. But somehow, I was transported back to the past when I was a five-year-old child. The moment I faced my father, who looked much younger now, a strange blue window appeared before my eyes — it was a pale blue window that revealed another’s inner self.

[Alderuan Erveldote]
Role: Emperor (Lv.99)
Favorability: 90,980,984
Mood: Dear daughter I miss you

…But Father...? I assume it’s Dad's feelings but… What the Hell is going on?

[Damian Erveldote]
Mood: Glad to see my sister
Thoughts: I want to talk to you T ^ T

[Ellie]
Mood: Holding back from breaking the wall because it’s too cute
Thoughts: I’ll definitely make a commemorative collection titled “The Daily Life of a Cute Princess!”

[Karmen Kasselov]
Mood: Excited
Thoughts: Why is it that every time I see you, you are one step more beautiful? What do they feed you at my palace? Do they have a magic potion that can make everyone this beautiful?

I used to think that everyone held a grudge against me, but seeing how they treat me like that I guess that’s not true?! If what the status window tells me is true then maybe I can live a better life in this lifetime!

‘…I don’t need it though?’

I wasn’t really a young kid lacking affection. And that gaze in which they looked at me as if I were the loveliest in the world was extremely uncomfortable. Just where would I use a fairy tale book that’s full of jewels and silk, and the magic pearl which is the Imperial family’s heirloom? Since it’s already been done, I just wish for everyone to get out of my palace.

Now, all that's left is to go home......

Or so she thought!

I am going to walk on my own flower path.

“Wherever I go, the seat next to you is mine. You promised to pat my head for the rest of your life, isn’t that right?” The strongest male character, who was stabbed to death in the original novel, stared at me with obsessive eyes.

If I say no, he will destroy the world.

“Yes, I’ll kill him. Then you’ll be happy, too, right?” The fifth brother looked a bit crazy.

“This is my land from here to here. And yours, too. I’m glad to be able to breathe with your grandest dreams.” The fourth oldest sister, who became the richest woman on the continent, opened the map and said that.

“I’m looking forward to the Winter Solstice that you’ll rule completely.” Laughter rose on the face of the butler who served me.

“If you don’t connect to Verratoux, my heart will stop tomorrow morning. Are you sure you’re okay with that?” My first sister, who was supposed to be the original successor, threatened me with her life.

And this is the biggest problem. Somehow, a faint smile raised my father’s mouth, which became stronger than the original father he was. “Independence? Try it then. I won’t even let a single ant live on this land.”

“Did you think you could leave my arms and stand on your own…” He then stared at me obsessively.

Bon appétit!,"맛본 김에 꿀꺽!, Masbon Gim-e Ggulggeog!, Bon Appetit, Swallow After Tasting, 投喂悲剧男二后，他想HE了！",manga,"""If I die after eating, that’ll be great!"" Luana was born an abandoned princess of a kingdom that would soon be occupied. It’s the story where her death was decided anyway, so she ate what she wanted to eat. Her cooking has captured The General of the Conquering Army, the duke who was cursed and can’t taste foods? ""There was nothing I wanted in this small kingdom, but now I think I do.” Why are you looking at me when you say that~?!!! The story of Legion, the occupier of the kingdom who lost his sense of taste due to the curse, and Luana, the only person who could make him taste food.

“Are you eating in this situation?”

“Of course! I’ll have to keep savoring the taste until I die. Do you want one?”

She was reincarnated in a novel as Luana, the abandoned princess. And her death was already decided. She just wanted to let people know about her cooking talent, but she was misunderstood as a witch because of her cheese jerky!

The General of the conquering army, Duke Legion, who had lost his sense of taste, took her to the Empire for her extraordinary jerkies and to break the curse that had come down from generation to generation.

“It is delicious, isn’t it?”

“Prepare the same for the dinner.”

She was happy to be able to cook and eat as much as delicious food as she wanted… But now, she also wanted to look after Legion.

‘Eat three meals a day, and make sure to make dessert. I’m sure he will be able to gain some weight…!’

–

The Duke took the jerky from the princess. On the surface, it was no different from any beef jerky. But when he took a bite of it, it felt like a new world had opened up. The jerky, made by the princess, felt more tender than the others as he gently crushed it with his teeth. The taste of condensed meat smudged his tongue as he chewed on. It was just as she said. He could feel the savory taste of the spicy meat, and at the end of the day, he wanted to have more. The desire that he had, faded for a while.

In the original novel, the male lead was trash who abandoned her after getting her pregnant, saying that he belatedly realized that he loved the heroine. Fortunately, it was still before the original work started. She decided to scrap that shit herself.

""No, I don't want to,"" she flatly rejected Killian's offer to have an affair with him.

When he asked her why, she smiled brightly and answered, ""Young Master is not my taste. If I must say, your younger brother is much preferable.”

""What? You prefer my younger brother?""

*Yeah. Not you, but your brother.*

Unlike the original, she firmly set up an iron wall, took care of Lexion, the younger brother who was abused by his elder brother, and protected the original female lead who had low-esteem from that shitty male lead.

And now that she'd already done what she had to do, she's off to go.

But a few years later–

Lexion, who had pushed out his older brother and taken the ducal title, came back to her as a beast with a decadent beauty. On top of that, he was even holding the engagement document that she had signed as a joke during their childhood.

""I've never forgotten you for a moment. Please marry me, Noona.""

*No, wasn't that just for playing house?*

Every time she refuses his marriage proposal, he gently hugs her around the waist, and asks in a cold voice, ""Did your taste change while I was away?""

Lexion's eyes were full of life as he asked.

It was as if when he found out who her type was, he'd kill them right away.

*But what is this? When I woke up from my sleep, I'm back to that hellish childhood! Is this a dream?! Hmph. If I can't wake up from this dream,  I'll at least live without too much consideration for others now!*

Just like that, Harley decided to go astray. Eugene, the ""dutiful son"" but cold, Cabel, the roughhousing knucklehead, and Erich, the angelic-looking bully and Arina's twin, *all three be damned!*

Harley thought that marriage would be her ticket out of the Ernst household and away from the family's three sons, aka her perpetual tormenters. But on the eve of her wedding, she's transported back in time 20 years to a youth she'd hoped to forget. As long as she's getting a second chance at childhood, Harley's determined to stand up to her bullies. But what began as retaliation quickly turns into reconciliation as both Harley and the Ernst brothers come to understand each other's pain.

Five hundred years ago, Rudolf von Goldenbaum united the disparate governments of humankind and established a mighty human empire, a tribute to his own greatness that stretched across the galaxy. Demanding loyalty and discipline, Rudolf created an order designed to long outlast his own rule; but all human works fade in time. Today, the decaying empire faces the threat of the Free Planets Alliance, and military leaders on both sides jockey for power in the face of a seemingly inevitable conflict. On the side of the empire, the young general Reinhard von Lohengramm sees war as opportunity, and the empire as soft clay ready for his own sculpting. On the side of the alliance, would-be historian Yang Wen-li would like nothing better than to live out his days in peace - but times of war have little use for men who waste their days studying the mistakes of the past. Circumstances will make heroes and villains of both these men, as they write new history one blood-splattered page at a time.

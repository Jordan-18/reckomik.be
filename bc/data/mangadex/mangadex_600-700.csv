The relationship between her brother and husband is strange.

""What do you mean? I said that I believe you, didn't I?""

""No,"" Archel said after a moment of silence.

""For real, it seems like you really do. I swear it seemed like you love me.""

That's just an illusion.

After watching my expression, the smile disappeared from Gael's face, ""Am I mistaken?""

Here, inside this martial arts novel, there is a true teacher who teaches the arrogant male lead and awakens him through death. Handsome, good-natured, righteous, strong, and… Anyway, there was one big flaw in the male lead's damn fine teacher. It was his foolish only daughter who was filled with greed. A tenacious villainous extra, who always comes back to haunt the male lead in every way, but cannot be abandoned because she is his teacher's daughter. Throughout reading the novel, I cursed at that daughter. Saying that if it were me, I wouldn't live like that.

'But that didn't mean that I wanted to be her!'

What was worse, Father has already died, and my reputation was the worst. Inevitably, I ran away, but… I died. However, when I opened my eyes, Father was alive?!

'If so, in this life, I will definitely save Father!'

However…

""To think they’re aiming for my granddaughter?! I'll kill them all!""

Why do I see Grandfather, who doesn't even appear many times throughout the novel, so often like this?

""Marriage? No. Yeonie said that she would live by my side for the rest of her life.""

Even Father, somehow became weird. Moreover:

""Why do you keep avoiding me? Is this also my mistake?""

Isn't the main character suddenly becoming obsessed with me?

""Originally, I was destined to die. Until you came here.""

I saved the time-limited bastard, but isn’t it that no good deed goes unpunished?

""At least when I'm in front of you… I don't think I’m trash.""

The villain who blew off my neck is suddenly trying to repent.

Is it really okay if it's like this?

Little Mushroom,小蘑菇,manga,"“Until the day humanity falls.”

In the year 2020, Earth’s magnetic poles disappeared and humankind was nearly wiped out by cosmic radiation. Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.

In the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.

An Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.

But An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…

Large mysterious alien ships have been looming above Japanese towns for three years, filling the sky. Everything changed three years ago. And yet, nothing has changed.

No weapon used against the invaders' ships had any success, beyond destroying part of Japan and leaving its economy in shambles. JSDF is fighting a guerrilla battle against the aliens all over Japan. America is joining the 'war' effort with more aggressive tactics, dividing Japan over the pacifist principle laid out in Article 9 of the Japanese constitution. But this may just be the mundane story of young high schoolers.

""No matter what happens, I won't back down. At least not until this world filled with lies and deceit crumbles away. The real threat to humankind is not invaders, but me.""

Attack!! Ramenman,闘将!! 拉麺男,manga,"A fighting manga set in China. Ramenman, the main character, travels from place to place, fighting various enemies. Originally debuting in Yudetamago's other early work, Kinnikuman, Ramenman became so popular (more so than Kinnikuman himself), that he got his own spinoff. It was serialized from June of 1982 to December of 1988 in Fresh Jump (officially ending in the January 23, 1989 issue, due to the suspension of the magazine itself).

[Don't you want to take revenge on those who thoroughly deceived and killed you?]

I decided to accept the devilishly sweet offer. This time, I will definitely get the guardian stone and become the head of the household. I will give you back as much or more than what I suffered. Until then, I will believe no one. But-

“From now on, no matter what happens, you must never stop and run.”

The image of him trying to save me, his eyes running in despair, couldn't be erased from my mind. The fiancé I loved was looking at me as I died, but why were you running to me with those eyes. You, who I thought was my sister's person... I want to know where your sincerity lies.

Helena Croisen, bastard child of the family, thought she would finally be acknowledged when the power of the guardian stone manifested in her. Little did she know, a conspiracy was going on behind her back — one that would end with her beloved fiancé stabbing her in the heart. As Helena draws her final breath, a mysterious voice speaks to her. “Do you wish for vengeance?” Next thing she knows, she’s gone back two years in time! Will Helena be able to avoid the same tragic fate this time around?

Haruyoshi (now Seika) is determined not to repeat his past mistakes in his second life by smartly laying low and avoiding flaunting his power. Yet accomplishing his goals and without drawing attention to himself proves to be easier said than done — will his powers be enough to live a happy life?!

This was neither a dream nor a hallucination. This feeling of hunger, fatigue, the vivid sense of everything around her… This was all real. If this was indeed reality… If God truly gave her one more precious chance…!

‘I’m going to carry out a business. A marriage is a business in the end. Zachary’s child will be the perfect source of financial support. I’m sure my dowry will remain safe too. I won’t have to lose the Blanchefort or Arno territories to that damned viscount either.’

Then whether it be through seduction or persuasion, she needed to give birth to her husband, Zachary’s child.

“How much was my dowry exactly?”

“400 calves, 900 pigs, 100 units of silverware, 300 rolls of silk, 2 crates of jewels, and a portion of a territory… Equivalent to a two-year budget for the Arno county.”

“Don’t you think you should compensate for that?”

The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the late 36th century. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.  
  
In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen Li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.  
As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: ""There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.""

Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as one of the outer district walls is damaged by a 60 meter (196.85 feet) Titan causing a breach in the wall. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror the tragic events that follow, as the Titans devour people unimpeded.

Eren vows that he will wipe out every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

A delightfully charming romantic comedy about a boy who only has eyes for the girl who always forgets her glasses!

With the new school year comes a new homeroom, new classmates, and a new desk for the timid Komura. But any trepidation he might've felt quickly dissipates when he catches sight of Mie, his new seat neighbor.

Unfortunately, Mie is pathologically forgetful and can never seem to remember to bring her glasses to class. It's not all bad, though! Her resulting squinty, mean-girl face sends Komura’s heart into overdrive too!

He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.

When Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Engine, who reveals himself to be a ""janitor""—someone who uses special weapons called ""jinkis"" to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Legto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a janitor to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.

Acer isn’t quite like the other high elves of the forest. For starters, he remembers living a past life as a human in another world...meaning he’s got a taste for meat, adventure, and plenty of other decidedly un-elven things! He’s also bored out of his skull after 120 years of the peace and quiet of their serene sylvan lifestyle. So with nothing more than his trusty bow, a bundle of life-giving fruit, and his close bond with the spirits of nature, Acer leaves the monotony of the forest behind to seek a new life, one that’s more his pace. See what excitement awaits in the outside world full of humans, dwarves, and even other elves!

- There are no missing chapters on MangaDex, Chapter 108 ""Warped"" immediately follows Chapter 97 ""Disposal of Olympias (2)"", this is because chapters were added together in previous volumes, so the chapter count between volume and magazine are out of sync.

Would lose its glow by morning’s soft embrace.

Hesitant they float and shy.
Carrying forest scents anew,
While hibiscus stays blushing in the dew.

Tomorrow, when the winds return,
The hibiscus longs for sweet scents to burn.
A flower with just beauty's grace,
Lacks a fragrance to embrace.
 
Winds, aware of this design,
Bestow the summer’s scent so fine.
The hibiscus blooms at dawn’s first light,
A truth strange, a wonder in sight.
 
Yet fate cannot be denied,
Blaming winds for love untried.
Without waiting for the day to break,
A silent farewell, hard to forsake.
 
Winds wander, searching for a face,
Is it the one who lost the race?

What a Wonderful World!,"多美好的人生, 素晴らしい世界",manga,"Being his first series, What a Wonderful World remains Asano's most representative and successful work to date. Composed of vignettes from the daily lives of a group of people inhabiting an ordinary neighborhood somewhere in Tokyo, the series is actually a comment about modern life itself and how we can survive in it despite all its rigors.  
  
Amusing, melancholic, funny, strange, thought-provoking, Asano effortlessly shifts from one mood to another, creating stories and characters that are profoundly human and thus always involving. It's a shame that not everyone will find the subjects the author describes equally appealing since some of them are distinctly Japanese. But overall, it's a great collection that any discerning manga reader should check out.

In the Adachi pantheon, this is a rare diametric view of his eternal theme of ""youth,"" in this case youth as seen through the lens of the past. It's a powerful statement from Adachi that might even be an acknowledgment of his steadily-creeping age.  
  
What is impressive about these stories is not the plots or characters themselves, but the absolutely perfect way he tells them, another facet of experience that comes with age. Most of the stories may require multiple readings to fully appreciate the airtightness of the plot and visual motifs.""
